# homeapp73-docker

A home web application, which shows 
- outdoor and indoor climate info
- family calendar from icloud
- booking calendar with booked/unbooked status
- Electricity spot price from Nordpool

The app can be shown on an always-on tablet as web page. The backend can be hosted on various machines, for example on a Raspberry PI.

# Background

I created the app to try out interesting technologies and make something useful from it. The app has been in daily use for many years as has proven it's value.

Because the target has been to learn and experiment, the app uses a large variety of programming languages and approaches to the problems at hand. It's not the simplest nor the most lightweight and it's lacking some error handling and security. Thus, it's not real-life production quality, but it's a fun and useful project that runs without issues on Raspberry PI 4. 

# Tech stack

Docker compose based containerized solution which can be run on a Raspberry PI. Contains a React app, NGINX gateway, multiple independent API services, various data fetching containers, InfluxDB time series database, solar inverter integration, sensor integration with MQTT client that integrates to Mosquitto MQTT bridge. More detailed description below:

## Frontend

### Client

Oldish Create React App based React application using class components. To be renewed to Next.js and React Server Components to create a more ligthweight client with better error handling and real-timeness.

### Gateway

NGINX provides a common protected endpoint for the client and hides the details of the API services.

## APIs

### Cabin bookings

Node.js/Express.js server that reads bookings from a MariaDB and returns them to the client. Cabinbookings-refersh is a periodically run container that scrapes a web site and writes the bookings into the MariaDB and local file system.

### Calendar service

A Python API that uses Flask as a the web framework. Fetches family calendar events from a CalDAV compliant calendar service and returns the events to the client.

### Climate service

A Python API using Flask framework. Reads indoor climate data and outdoor history data from an InfluxDB database and gets real-time weather forecast from Finnish Meteorological Institute.

### Electricity service

Golang based API that reads the real-time solar panel production from InfluxDB and returns it to the client.

### Nordpool

A Rust API that reads prices from Nordpool and returns them to the client.

## Databases

### InfluxDB

InfluxDB database that contains timeseries data, such as sensor, solar inverter and weather data.

### MariaDB

Database for relational data, such as cabin bookings

## Data ingestion

### Mosquitto

MQTT broker that takes in MQTT messages from sensors and sends them to the subscriber(s) such as MQTT Client service.

### MQTT client

A Python application that reads messages from Mosquitto MQTT broker and writes them to the InfluxDB database.

### Zigbee2MQTT

A service that makes the USB-plugged Zigbee device talk with the Mosquitto MQTT server.

### Sofar_lsw3

Solar inverter reader application, which uses Wifi to connect to the ModBus interface of the solar inverter and stores the data in InfluxDB

## Monitoring

### Prometheus

A Prometheus instance which uses Node Exporter to read metrics from the Raspberry PI host system and stores them in its database.

### Grafana

A report web site that reads Prometheus data and shows it in a dashboard.

# Getting started 
## Running locally with mockup data
- Install node on your machine (e.g. `brew install node` if you are on Mac and using Brew)
- In the homeclient folder, execute `npm run withmockup` to open the client in development mode using mockup data

Mariadb
- Create docker.env file and set the following environment variables:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={your root password}
    CABIN_USER_PASSWORD={password for cabin user}
Cabinbookings-refresh
- Create .env file and set the following environment variables:
    URL={url to bookign system}
    USERNAME={username to the booking system}
    PASSWORD={password to the bookings system}
    DBUSER={username to the mariadb}
    DBPASSWORD={password to the DBUSER}
