# homeapp73-docker

A home application that monitors weather and indoor climate. Also displays an icloud family calendar. 

This is a draft branch that tries to get the containers running on Kubernetes (k3s). The solution is mostly working but so cumbersome that this approach is not continued. Use Docker instead of Kubernetes for home projects, unless you really want to spend time on Kubernetes.
